                        <hr>
                        <p>We would love to introduce ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Lunita Hermosa's grand opening was in 2020 and we continously provided our best effort for our customers.</p>
                        <p>We have a strong philosophy that food should provide a sense of comfort to forget our problems.</p> 
                        <p>To enhance this experience, we have recently introduced table side aquariums to those who dine in our restaurant.
                            These aquariums provide fresh air into our restaurant and of course provide a beautiful, calming view for you to enjoy
                        </p>
                        <p>We hope this unique dining experience brings you as much joy as we love providing it!</p>
